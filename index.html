		<p>Hi, I’m Wesley. I’m just a guy with a camera and a passion. That passion is YouTube. It gives me an outlet to share my stories. What are those stories? Well, as I type this I must be honest and say that I am still finding that voice. I document travel destinations, create ridiculous food tutorials, offer product reviews, and just generally vlog. If I’m being really honest this is currently just a hobby for me. My ultimate goal would be to open a studio where YouTubers young and old can come and have a space to hang out and create. I envision a studio with several recording stages ready for your inspirations to become reality. From green screens, to a functioning kitchen, to gaming stations for streaming. A place for anyone with a camera and a vision to come and have a safe, great place to launch their creations. That’s why I’m here and why I do what I do.
